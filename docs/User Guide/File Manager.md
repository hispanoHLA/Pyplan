# File Manager
Clicking on the folder icon found at the left menu you will access the file manager.
It is important to notice that the left pane works as a navigation tool. You can navigate through the folders hierarchy opening or closing folders by clicking the + icon or double clicking on the folder.
The right pane is where you will be selecting files for operating with them (deleting, renaming, etc).
