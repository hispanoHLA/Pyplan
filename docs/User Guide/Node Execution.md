You can run any node, after editing its code, pressing <kbd>CTRL + Enter</kbd>.
It will show at the right side of the code window the console output resulting from running the node.

Any `Print()` statement written between code lines will display it result here.
It is intended for rapid evaluation of the node, to check it is properly defined.

## Result Explorer
Other way to run a node is by pressing <kbd>CTRL + E</kbd>.
This way of running displays more complete information about the node properties and its result.

One of the most interesting feature accesible through this way of evaluation is the "Show Profile" feature that display the calculation path calculation time and memory usage by step (nodes)

## Evaluating a Node
<kbd>CTRL + R</kbd> to get its result

You can evaluate a node by double clicking on it or pressing <kbd>CTRL + R</kbd> after selecting it.
Differently with the previous run alternatives, the node is run and it result displayed in a new tab, called as the "Title" of the node, with a default table format.

Pyplan natively interprets Numpy matrix, Pandas dataframe indexes and Xarray dimensions, that will be automatically displayed at the bottom of the table for pivoting and filtering.
Any default view can be changed using the Edit interface menu that can be launched clicking on the icon shown in the image below
