Any `Print()` statement written between code lines will display it result here.
It is intended for rapid evaluation of the node, to check it is properly defined.

## Result Explorer
Other way to run a node is by pressing <kbd>CTRL + E</kbd>.
This way of running displays more complete information about the node properties and its result.

One of the most interesting feature accesible through this way of evaluation is the "Show Profile" feature that display the calculation path calculation time and memory usage by step (nodes)
