# Visualization
When a node is run (double clicking it) its result can be rendered as a table, a pivot table, different type of graphs, or a map.
The visualization type is selected clicking on the configuration wheel that appears when you enter in the visualization edit mode. After clicking the configuration wheel the following menu is displayed to navigate and set the options.

The first choice to be made is about the type of chart (Table, Graph or Map). The menu is accessed clicking on the first option called "Chart and filters".

# Tables
There are two type of tables intended for different purposes. Regular tables and pivot tables.
The image below show some different configuration features from these tables:


## Regular Table
Is the default view of any node. The user can pivot dimensions and filter any dimension by clicking the `(all)` legend next to each dimension.
It is possible to generate custom configurations by rows or cols. Heatmaps and Background colors based on customized ranges are also possible.

## Pivot Tables
Different than the standard table It allows multiple dimensions in rows or cols as well as filtering.
It has fewer customization options compared to regular tables.

But one main differentiation is that can work as an input table, allowing the user to manually change table values.
