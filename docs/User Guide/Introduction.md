# **User Guide**
The following sections covers basic functionalities and features of Pyplan.
Pyplan is in permanent evolution so that it is probable you will find minor differences between this document and the last Pyplan version running online.

## **What you will find in this User Guide**
-------------
The user guide has been structured in the following sections:
### Pyplan App Homepage
Where it is described the application main menu and tools.
### File Manager
Users have their own workspace and can also access a Public workspace. The File Manager provides assistance for working with files related to your applications.
### Model
Pyplan organizes Python code in nodes that are represented as a workflow (influence diagram). In this section it is explained all the tools and features created for helping to build the calculation and data manipulation logic.
### Visualization
Calculation steps are contained in nodes that end with a result. These nodes can be evaluated and its result displayed as table, graph or map.
All native Pyplan visualization alternatives and parameters configuration are described in this section. 
It is important to highlight that it is also possible to use many other visualization libraries available in Python like for example [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) or [Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) for rendering results.

### Interface Designer
Visualization and user controls are grouped in interfaces for letting the user interact with your app and explore results. In this chapter it will be explained how to create, configure and share this apps. **Most important: no coding required!**

### Configuration
The enterprise version of Pyplan is installed on a server or provided as a service through A. In this section it is explored the app architecture and how to administer users regarding security and resources.

### Tutorials and Examples
In the Public folder that you can access through the File Manager, you will find tutorials that will explain **"How to"** do many things.
The Examples are intended to demonstrate what is possible to do. It is up to you to go through its code to understand how to adapt or reuse any piece of code in your own project.


## **What you will NOT find in this User Guide**
-------------
Pyplan can be considered a Python integrated development environment for data analytics apps. It is not the purpose of this user guide to explain how to programming in Python, neither on any of the other used libraries like Pandas, Numpy or Xarray just to name a few.
There are plenty of introductory tutorials and courses for you to learn from.
An always good source of information will be the libraries own documentation.
And for any challenging task you can also count with the community help gathered in sites like StackOverflow.

## **Formerly Cubeplan users**
-------------
**Pyplan** is the software evolution of **Cubeplan**. The improvement were so radical that required a change in the name of the product. But in order to make it easy for former Cubeplan users migrate to Pyplan it has been created a Library that reproduces, as similar as possible, Cubeplan functions and syntax.
Cubeplan models can not be run in Pyplan. It is a good way to learn Python migrate an existing Cubeplan model.
