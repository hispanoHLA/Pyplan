# Pyplan Library

Pyplan is an open source library providing easy-to-use labelled data structures and data analysis functions for [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.

Pyplanlib is based on Xarray DataArray object and take advantage of its N-dimensional arrays.

Pyplanlib pp.cube and pp.index are mirrors of Xarray Dataarray and Coords but managed in a more structured manner so that businessmen and data scientist can easily create models with a bunch of python tools.

Pyplanlib has an extensive number of functions that help modelers developing.

## Main concept

## Data Structure
Based on X-Array objects, with a different approach to index definition and manipulation

## Goals
Pyplanlib aims to become development package for data scientist and businessmen phasing problems where a huge quantity of data needed be analyse and structure.

Complex problems and sophisticated mathematical operations involving multidimensional arrays should be solved using this library.

Pyplanlib combines and enhance Numpy, Pandas and Xarray concepts.
