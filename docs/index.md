# Pyplan
Pyplan is an assisted Graphical Integrated Development Environment designed for easy creation and sharing of Data Analytics Apps based on Python programming language.

The app code is structured through an Influence Diagram ( a Workflow) that helps understanding the calculation logic.

Every node has several properties and code that can be evaluated to ins

Each calculation step is contained in a node which can be evaluated and its results represented as a table or graph. 



The node works as a blank canvas for programming in Python, and accepts imports of any external library. Results are stored in memory as global variables that can be called from other calculations.

Pyplan natively interprets Pandas, Numpy and XArray dataobjects. That means that any node which result is an object of these types can be represented as a table or graph with no additional coding.


## Old definition
conceived for introducing data scientists and business analyst into Python models and it Machine Learning and Data Analytics potential.

Trough an innovative U/I consisting on influence diagrams, huge models can be easily construct and audit by software experts as well as businessmen.
