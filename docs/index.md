# **Pyplan**
Pyplan is an assisted **Graphical Integrated Development Environment** designed for easy creation and sharing of **Data Analytics Apps** based on **Python** programming language.

## **Code Organization**
The app code is structured through a hierarchicaln Influence Diagram of nodes -( a Workflow- that helps understand the calculation logic.
Nodes are added by a driag and drop user interface and Python code is written inside their definition. 
![enter image description here](http://img.pyplan.org/index_node_code.png)

Nodes have several properties: Title, ID, Units, Inputs, Outputs that are displayed when focus. 
The ID allows calling its result from other nodes, working as global variables.

## **Node alu**

Each calculation step is contained in a node which can be evaluated and its results represented as a table or graph. 
***(insertar gr√°fico con nodo y su definicion)***

The node works as a blank canvas for programming in Python, and accepts imports of any external library. Results are stored in memory as global variables that can be called from other calculation**s.
Pyplan natively interprets Pandas, Numpy and XArray dataobjects. That means that any node which result is an object of these types can be evaluated (by double clicking the node) and visualized with native Pyplan charts and tables with no additional coding.

When asking to run a node, all precedent nodes are calculated too, and its results are kept in memory, available for inspection and reuse. Pyplan engine keeps track of any change represented as a table or graph with no additional coding.


## Old definition
conceived for introducing data scientists and business analyst into Python models and it Machine Learning a node that triggers recalculation downstream the logic.

## **Using Python Libraries**
Any library from the extended Python developing community can be imported to be used to solve specific needs.

The example above imports Sklearn for machinnd Data Analytics potential.

Trough an innovative U/I consisting on influence diagrams, huge models can be learning and the Plottly for rendering the visualization. A Plotly 3D representation is appreciated in the figure below.

## **Creating Apps**
Apps interfaces are created dragging and dropping model nodes on an interface design tool.

After creation, the app can be shared with anybody internally or outside the enterprise environment.
