# Pyplan
Pyplan is an assisted Graphical Integrated Development Environment designed for easy creation and sharing of Data Analytics Apps based on Python programming language.
The app code is structured through an Influence Diagram ( a Workflow) that helps understanding the calculation logic.
***(insertar gráfico con diagrama de influencia)***

Each calculation step is contained in a node which can be evaluated and its results represented as tables or graphs. 
***(insertar gráfico con nodo y su definicion)***

The node works as a blank canvas for programming, and its result is stored in memory as a global variable that can be called from other calculations.


#conceived for introducing data scientists and business analyst into #Python models and it Machine Learning and Data Analytics #potential.

Trough an innovative U/I consisting on influence diagrams, huge models can be easily construct and audit by software experts as well as businessmen.
