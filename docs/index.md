# Pyplan
Pyplan is an assisted Graphical Integrated Development Environment designed for easy creation and sharing of Data Analytics Apps based on Python programming language.
The app code is structured through an Influence Diagram ( a Workflow) that helps understanding the calculation logic.

Each calculation step is contained in a node which can be evaluated and its results represented as tables or graphs.

The node works as a blank canvas for programming in Python, and accepts imports of any external library. Results are stored in memory as global variables that can be called from other calculations.
Pyplan natively interprets Pandas, Numpy and XArray dataobjects. That means that any node which result is an object of these type can be represented as a table or graph with no additional coding.
