# Pyplan
Pyplan is an assisted Graphical Integrated Development Environment conceived for introducing data scientists and business analyst into Python models and it Machine Learning and Data Analytics potential.

Trough an innovative U/I consisting on influence diagrams, huge models can be easily construct and audit by software experts as well as businessmen.

Pyplan main object is called “node” and it´s codification, after importing any Python Library, can be easily done through its **_code_** windows.
Numpy Array could be codified as:

    >result = np.array([1,2,3])

Check that final line of Pyplan node should have the expression **_result=_** in order to indicate node which is going to be the final object of the code.
Numpy Array could be codified as:

By pressing **_Ctrl+R_** Pyplan will evaluate this object and show results in a table.

Graphical representation can be simple access through table menu:

And result will be shown as a graph

As simple as indicated Python based model can be structure.
