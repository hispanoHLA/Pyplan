Pyplan main object is called “node” and it´s codification, after importing any Python Library, can be easily done through its **_code_** windows.
Numpy Array could be codified as:

    >result = np.array([1,2,3])

Check that final line of Pyplan node should have the expression **_result=_** in order to indicate node which is going to be the final object of the code.
Numpy Array could be codified as:

By pressing **_Ctrl+R_** Pyplan will evaluate this object and show results in a table.

Graphical representation can be simple access through table menu:

And result will be shown as a graph

As simple as indicated Python based model can be structure.

Pyplan also provides user friendly interfaces for model management and API deployment. Check more about these topics on following chapters.
