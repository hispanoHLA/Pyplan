# **Quick Start**

## Login

You must have installed Pyplan in a server to access Pyplan.
Or you can request a trial account to access Pyplan cloud services [here](http://pyplan.com/contact/).

Once identified the server address and with valid user you can login Pyplan through a regular Login form:

After login in, you will reach the app landpage that looks like:
![Pyplan Homepage](http://img.pyplan.org/Quick_start_home.png)
With sections for creating a new model, open existing one, recover any active session, or opening tutorials and examples.

## User Interface Menu
At the homepage click on create a new model, and then click on "Open Model"
![Open Model](http://img.pyplan.org/Quick_start_open_model.png)
Clicking on Open Model, you will access the sandbox for creating your model logic.

### Coding
There are five basic components for creating and organizing the calculation logic. F
A Node is the place where you code your calculation logic. It can start with a node that read an external data source, followed by another node that makes some calculations and end with a node that produces a desired output.

or now just drag and drop a "Node" into the canvas.

### Input Nodes


Pyplan main object is called “node” and it´s codification, after importing any Python Library, can be easily done through its **_code_** windows.
Numpy Array could be codified as:

    >result = np.array([1,2,3])

Check that final line of Pyplan node should have the expression **_result=_** in order to indicate node which is going to be the final object of the code.
Numpy Array could be codified as:

By pressing **_Ctrl+R_** Pyplan will evaluate this object and show results in a table.

Graphical representation can be simple access through table menu:

And result will be shown as a graph

As simple as indicated Python based model can be structure.

Pyplan also provides user friendly interfaces for model management and API deployment. Check more about these topics on following chapters.
