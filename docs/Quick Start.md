Pyplan main object is called “node” and it´s codification, after importing any Python Library, can be easily done through its **_code_** windows.
Numpy Array could be codified as:

    >result = np.array([1,2,3])

Check that final line of Pyplan node should have the expression **_result=_** in order to indicate node which is going to be the final object of the code.
Numpy Array could be codified as:

As simple as indicated Python based model can be structure.

Pyplan also provides user friendly interfaces for model management and API deployment. Check more about these topics on following chapters.
